I am a first-year Convergence Science PhD student funded by Cancer Research UK, based at the Francis Crick 
Institute and Imperial College London. Working under the guidance of Prof. Samra Turajilic and Dr. Guang Yang,
my research focuses on developing artificial intelligence models to analyse haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole 
slide images from the TRACERx Renal cohort. By automating this analysis, my goal is to facilitate downstream 
investigations into the tumor microenvironment of renal cancer carcinoma.
