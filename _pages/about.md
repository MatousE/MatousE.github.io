I'm a final-year undergraduate student at Newcastle University studying Computer Science (with an Industrial Placement) BSc. 
As part of my course I've just completed a year-long placement at the Francis Crick Institute, in the 
Electron Microscopy Science Technology Platform. I am passionate about applying computer science to the field of Biology. 
Most recently this has been in the form of Bioimage Analysis where I am currently creating new techniques to automate the 
task of segmenting biological structures in volume electron microscopy data.
